. The n dimensional analog of the triangle is the n simplex. This is the
smallest convex set in a Euclidean space

m containing n + 1 points v0
, ··· , vn
that do not lie in a hyperplane of dimension less than n, where by a hyperplane
we mean the set of solutions of a system
of linear equations. An equivalent condition would be that the difference vectors
v1 − v0
, ··· , vn − v0 are linearly independent. The points vi are the vertices of the
simplex, and the simplex itself is denoted [v0
, ··· , vn].

The Rips complex is much easier to compute with, and its persistent
homology accurately models that of the Cech complex. 

filtered complex is an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes. It determines an
 inductive system of homology groups

Specifically, we show that the persistent homology of a filtered ddimensional simplicial
 complex is simply the standard homology of a particular graded
module over a polynomial ring. 
Our analysis of persistent homology, on the other hand, provides a
complete, effective, and implementable algorithm for any filtered complex.
